** Method resolution: is the process of which method has to execute.  **

** Method signature: is the method name followed by arguments types.  **

## Method overloading:
- Methods with the same name but with difference arguments types
  (at least in order)	
- In method overloading the method resolution takes care by complier based 
  on reference object BUT not based on run time object
- SO Method overloading is also known as compile time polymorohism or static polymorphism or early binding.    

## Method overriding:
- In method overriding the method resolution takes care by jvm based on 
  run time object reference.
- SO method overriding is also known as run time polymorphism or dynamic polymorphism or late binding.
